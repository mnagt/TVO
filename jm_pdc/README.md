About
============
In invoicing and billing, a post-dated cheque (PDC) is one that a customer or vendor (payer) writes with a future date. The ability to cash or deposit such cheques before their written date varies by country. Currently, Odoo lacks built-in functionality to manage post-dated cheques, which is why we've developed this module. This module facilitates the management of post-dated cheques with corresponding accounting journal entries.

With this module, you can easily register and manage post-dated cheques for both customers and vendors. It allows you to track and move cheques through various states such as new, registered, returned, deposited, bounced, and completed. Each state is meticulously handled with appropriate accounting journal entries. You can also filter and list cheques based on their status, and generate simple PDF reports.
